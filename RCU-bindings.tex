%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This document is based on WG21/P0279R1 combined with feedback at
the 2015 Kona and 2016 Jacksonville meetings, which most notably called
for a C++-style method of handling different RCU implementations or
domains within a single translation unit, and which also contains
useful background material and references.
Unlike WG21/P0279R1, which simply introduced RCU's C-language practice,
this document presents proposals for C++-style RCU APIs.
At present, it appears that these are not conflicting proposals, but
rather ways of handling different C++ use cases resulting from
inheritance, templates, and different levels of memory pressure.

Note that this proposal is related to the hazard-pointer proposal in
that both proposals defer destructive actions such as reclamation until
all readers have completed.

Note also that a redefinition of the infamous \co{memory_order_consume}
is the subject of a separate paper.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:Base RCU API}
shows the base RCU API as provided by implementations such as
userspace RCU~\cite{MathieuDesnoyers2009URCU,PaulMcKenney2013LWNURCU}.
This API is provided for compatibility with existing practice as
well as to provide the highest performance for the

Lines~1 and~2 show \co{rcu_read_lock()} and \co{rcu_read_unlock()},
which mark the beginning and the end, respectively, of an \emph{RCU read-side
critical section}.
These primitives may be nested, and matching \co{rcu_read_lock()}
and \co{rcu_read_unlock()} calls need not be in the same scope.
(That said, it is good practice to place them in the same scope
in cases where the entire critical section fits comfortably into
one scope.)

Line~3 shows \co{synchronize_rcu()}, which waits for any pre-existing
RCU read-side critical sections to complete.
The period of time that \co{synchronize_rcu()} is required to wait is
called a \emph{grace period}.
Note that a given call to \co{synchronize_rcu()} is \emph{not} required to
wait for critical sections that start later.

Lines~4 and~5 show \co{call_rcu()}, which, after a subsequent grace period
elapses, causes the \co{cbf(rhp)} \emph{RCU callback function} to be invoked.
Thus, \co{call_rcu()} is the asynchronous counterpart to
\co{synchronize_rcu()}.
In most cases, \co{synchronize_rcu()} is easier to use, however, \co{call_rcu()}
has the benefit of moving the grace-period delay off of the updater's
critical path.
Use of \co{call_rcu()} is thus critically important for good performance of
update-heavy workloads, as has been repeatedly discovered by any number of
people new to RCU~\cite{PaulEMcKenney2015ReadMostly}.

Note that although \co{call_rcu()}'s callbacks are guaranteed not to be
invoked too early, there is no guarantee that their execution won't be
deferred for a considerable time.
This can be a problem if a given program requires that all outstanding
RCU callbacks be invoked before that program terminates.
The \co{rcu_barrier()} function shown on line~6 is intended for this
situation.
This function blocks until all callbacks corresponding to previous
\co{call_rcu()} invocations have been invoked and also until after
those invocations have returned.
Therefore, taking the following steps just before terminating a program
will guarantee that all callbacks have completed:

\begin{enumerate}
\item	Take whatever steps are required to ensure that there are no
	further invocations of \co{call_rcu()}.
\item	Invoke \co{rcu_barrier()}.
\end{enumerate}

Carrying out this procedure just prior to program termination can be very
helpful for avoiding false positives when using tools such as valgrind.

Many RCU implementations require that every thread announce itself to
RCU prior to entering the first RCU read-side critical section, and
to announce its departure after exiting the last RCU read-side
critical section.
These tasks are carried out via the \co{rcu_register_thread()} and
\co{rcu_unregister_thread()}, respectively.

The implementations of RCU that feature the most aggressive implementations of
\co{rcu_read_lock()} and \co{rcu_read_unlock()} require that each thread
periodically pass through a \emph{quiescent state}, which is announce to RCU
using \co{rcu_quiescent_state()}.
A thread in a quiescent state is guaranteed not to be in an RCU
read-side critical section.
Threads can also announce entry into and exit from \emph{extended
quiescent states}, for example, before and after blocking system
calls, using \co{rcu_thread_offline()} and \co{rcu_thread_online()}.

\subsection{RCU Domains}
\label{sec:RCU Domains}

The userspace RCU library features several RCU implementations, each
optimized for different use cases.

The quiescent-state based reclamation (QSBR) implementation is intended
for standalone applications where the developers have full control
over the entire application, and where extreme read-side performance
and scalability is required.
Applications use \co{#include "urcu-qsbr.hpp"} to select QSBR and
\co{-lurcu -lurcu-qsbr} to link to it.
These applications must use \co{rcu_register_thread()} and
\co{rcu_unregister_thread()} to announce the coming and going
of each thread that is to execute \co{rcu_read_lock()} and
\co{rcu_read_unlock()}.
They must also use \co{rcu_quiescent_state()}, \co{rcu_thread_offline()},
and \co{rcu_thread_online()} to announce quiescent states to RCU.

The memory-barrier implementation is intended for applications that
can announce threads (again using \co{rcu_register_thread()} and
\co{rcu_unregister_thread()}), but for which announcing quiescent states is
impractical.
Such applications use \co{#include "urcu-mb.hpp"} and
\co{@@@} to select the memory-barrier implementation.
Such applications will incur the overhead of a full memory barrier in
each call to \co{rcu_read_lock()} and \co{rcu_read_unlock()}.

The signal-based implementation represents a midpoint between the QSBR
and memory-barrier implementations.
Like the memory-barrier implementation, applications must announce
threads, but need not announce quiescent states.
On the one hand, readers are almost as fast as in the QSBR implementation,
but on the other applications must give up a signal to RCU, by default
\co{SIGUSR1}.
Such applications use \co{#include "urcu-signal.hpp"} and
\co{@@@} to select signal-based RCU.

So-called ``bullet-proof RCU'' avoids the need to announce either threads
or quiescent states, and is therefore the best choice for use by
libraries that might well be linked with RCU-oblivious applications.
The penalty is that \co{rcu_read_lock()} incurs both a memory barrier
and a test and \co{rcu_read_unlock()} incurs a memory barrier.
Such applications or libraries use \co{#include urcu-bp.hpp} and
\co{@@@}.

\subsection{Run-Time Domain Selection}
\label{sec:Run-Time Domain Selection}

\begin{figure}[tbp]
{ \scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
 1   class rcu_domain {
 2   public:
 3     virtual void register_thread() = 0;
 4     virtual void unregister_thread() = 0;
 5     virtual void read_lock() noexcept = 0;
 6     virtual void read_unlock() noexcept = 0;
 7     virtual void synchronize() noexcept = 0;
 8     virtual void call(class rcu_head *rhp,
 9           void cbf(class rcu_head *rhp)) = 0;
10     virtual void barrier() noexcept = 0;
11     virtual void quiescent_state() noexcept = 0;
12     virtual void thread_offline() noexcept = 0;
13     virtual void thread_online() noexcept = 0;
14   };
\end{verbatim}
}
\caption{RCU Domain Base Class}
\label{fig:RCU Domain Base Class}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:RCU Domain Base Class}
shows the abstract base class for runtime selection of RCU domains.
Each domain creates a concrete subclass that implements its RCU APIs:

\begin{itemize}
\item	Bullet-proof RCU: \co{class rcu_bp}
\item	Memory-barrier RCU: \co{class rcu_mb}
\item	QSBR RCU: \co{class rcu_qsbr}
\item	Signal-based RCU: \co{class rcu_signal}
\end{itemize}

\section{Scoped Readers}
\label{sec:Scoped Readers}

@@@

Question:  Is it reasonable to have a type-oblivious implementation?
	If not, what the heck am I supposed to do?

Need comparison with hazard pointers.  Start with table in Maged's
	and my working drafts.  Note different motivations for
	SRCU-like domains.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:Summary}

This paper reviewed the 2016 discussions of \co{memory_order_consume}
that took place at the Jacksonville meeting, presented several representative
use cases, listed evaluation criteria, presented a number of
marking proposals (two in depth), and provided a comparative
evaluation.

A combination of typed object modifier (for C compatibility) and
a template class (for C++), similar to the approach used by atomics.
For standalone applications, these should be further combined with an
unmarked option, where the implementation assumes that everything that
could legally marked is so marked.
